# Project "old-pies"

***HELLO!***  
Welcome to **old-pies**, one of my first ever solo git projects!

![Rei says HI!](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.4_uzNhLssKCqBkhPsWCP8wHaEK?w=316&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7, "Rei Chiquita")

Now, a quick introduction to myself - I go by the user *data_by_rei* as a homage of sorts to the character Rei Ayanami from the cult classic anime series, Evangelion. As to the person behind the screen, I'm a recent graduate from UAlberta with a bachelors degree specializing in *business technology management* and *operations management*.

Unfortunately, as of right now I have yet to be "professionally" employed - seemingly trapped at my retail job. Thus, the creation of this project and future ones is to both reestablish and reaffirm to myself that I am **NOT** trapped.

...*oh*. sorry, what did i say?  
Um, what I **meant** to say was that this is just a silly little passion project of mine and a way for me to both present my skills and learn new ones! :)

## FAQs

### Purpose of project?

This project is a refurbishing of my old python projects from school, with applications ranging from dice rollers to renditions of games like the oh-so-popular Wordle.

### What is an "old-pie"?

It is a play-on-words relative to "old-python-projects".  
It was the most clever nickname I could come up with on the spot so don't come at me.

### Where are the projects located?

Given that this is just an archive of old projects, I went with the simple (yet controversial) approach of compiling each project into this single repo and separating them into their own subfolders.

### Why GIT?

I've always wanted to establish an online archive of my work on GIT - I've just never had the time and/or willpower to do it until now.
Also, I suppose I could say something about the pros of using GIT for version control and project management but I'll leave that to Google.
